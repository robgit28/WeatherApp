WeatherApp
The Weather App Project locates where the user is, if the user gives permission. The interface shows the location of the user. gives a description of the weather, a relevant weather icon and a click event which changes the temprature from celcius to fahrenheit. It is a work in progress and still needs some refinement around changing background colour according to temprature.
